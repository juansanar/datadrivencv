# datadrivencv
Seems I got tired of using LaTeX and dealng with its errors, I am switching to ``datadrivencv`` as R and Rstudio continue to permeate my workflow.

Credits to [@nstrayer](https://github.com/nstrayer/) who developed the [``datadrivencv``](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) R package and the amazing open source community working on [``pagedown``](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).
